    <h3>All Info About Appartment</h3>
    <div class="info" class="center">
        <p2>Villas have great privacy. Havenâ€™t we all been in a place where neighbors are the constant trouble? No one
            likes a nosy neighbor who frequently knocks at the door or the one who has prying eyes, checking for who
            enters and leaves. Sound annoying right? Surely it does. But living in a villa gives you the privacy you
            were always looking for. A villa offers you a community living, but you definitely have your own private
            space to enjoy. You have your own terrace and a backyard; you will not have to share it with anyone. There
            is no one to intrude on your private space. Spending time with your friends and family becomes more
            enjoyable. </p2>
